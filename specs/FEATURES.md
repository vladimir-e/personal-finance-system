# Features

Prioritized user-facing backlog. Items at the top are next; items at the bottom are future ideas.

## Priority 1 -- Core functionality

### Transaction entry
Record income and expenses with amount, date, description, and account. This is the fundamental operation -- everything else builds on having transactions in the system.

### Account management
Create and manage financial accounts (checking, savings, credit card, cash). Each transaction belongs to an account. Account balances are derived from transaction history.

## Priority 2 -- Data portability

### CSV import
Import transactions from bank CSV exports. Most banks offer CSV download. This is the fastest path to a populated system without manual entry.

### CSV export
Export transaction data to CSV for backup or use in other tools.

## Priority 3 -- Financial insight

### Budget tracking
Set monthly spending targets by category. Compare actual spending against budget. Show remaining budget and overspend alerts.

### Category management
Create, edit, and organize transaction categories. Support for category hierarchies (e.g., Food > Groceries, Food > Restaurants).

## Future ideas

- Multi-currency support with exchange rates
- Recurring transaction templates
- Financial reports and charts
- Receipt photo attachment
- Search and filtering across all transactions
- Data sync between devices (requires storage adapter work)
